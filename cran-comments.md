Re-submission without changes

Regarding failing reverse dependency checks:

- In both cases the issues are just with over-zealous tests rather then with
  real breaking of the respective package.
- The author of the pipeflow package has been informed and I submitted a PR
  to fix the failing test in their package.
- The second package, lgrExtra is my own. A new version of lgrExtra has already 
  been prepared and will be submitted as soon as lgr is on it's way to CRAN. 
  
I hope this is satisfactory
